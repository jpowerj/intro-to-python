    "First things first, what exactly *is* Python?\n",
    "* ***Programming* Language**: In fact, a *Turing complete* programming language, which means that anything a computer can possibly do you can do with Python (unlike SQL, HTML, or CSS)\n",
    "* ***Interpreted* Language**: No compilation required, you can just start typing and seeing results! In older languages like C/C++, you had to *compile* your code down into a language (assembly code) that the processor can understand, and you had to wait for this compilation to complete before you could run the program. Python, on the other hand, implements \"on-the-fly execution\", meaning that it converts the code, sends it down to the processor, gets back the result, and prints it out, all in real time (note that this \"real time\" may still be extremely slow). Thus we call Python an \"interpreted\" rather than \"compiled\" language.\n",
    "* ***Dynamically-Typed* Language**: First, we need to understand what we mean when we say \"type\" in programming contexts. Any variable that you create, in any language, has a \"type\". For example, the number `3` has type integer (`int` in Python), the string of characters \"hello\" has type string (`str` in Python), the true/false value `True` has type boolean (`bool` in Python). Since these are \"basic\" datatypes, i.e., since they are built into Python, they are called \"primitive\" types. Any more complicated variable in Python is ultimately a combination of these primitive types. For example, the `pandas` data science library has a `DataFrame` type, which is essentially a spreadsheet of numbers or strings, and thus is really just a fancy combination of these two primitive types.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now, when we say Python is \"dynamically typed\", this means that any variable you create, say `day`, could refer to a *string* at one point in the code but then to an *int* at other points. This sounds scary, but it just means you need to keep track in your head of what type `day` *should* have when you're using it. For example, the following code should raise a red flag in your head (note that the \"`#`\" character represents a comment, so that everything after \"`#`\" on a line is just a note-to-self):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    day = 3 # day now refers to the int 3\n",
    "    # some other code...\n",
    "    day = \"Tuesday\" # day is *changed* to refer to the string \"Tuesday\"\n",
    "    # the rest of the code...\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    So `day` *started* the program as referring to a number, but then was \"dynamically typed\" to refer instead to a string. You should use comments, good variable names, and other good coding practices to avoid situations where someone using your code doesn't know what type a variable is at what point in the code D:\n",
    "    \n",
    "As a final note before we start, it's important to know that Python is sweeping a *lot* of things -- complicated things that have foisted many an emergency all-nighter onto computer scientists -- under the rug:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assembly, the \"first\" language in a sense, solely allows moving 0s and 1s around in your computer's memory. Then C came and was a bit more human-readable, but still required programmers to explicitly *allocate* sectors of memory space, and *free* these sectors when they were no longer needed. Then Java came with a \"garbage collector\", which meant that it would *scan* memory and automatically free up any sectors you weren't using. Finally, we have Python, which did all of the above automatically *plus* interpreted code in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of all this is just that, depending on what you're hoping to *do* with the computer, Python may not be the best language for the task. For example, if you're trying to perform a complex estimation procedure as fast as possible, a language like C is probably better, since the compilation process *optimizes* the machine code to be as fast as possible, unlike Python which just runs it as you type it.\n",
    "\n",
    "BUT, since we're social scientists, Python is *usually* the right language for the job, since this sweeping-under-rugs allows you to do a *ton* of cool/complex stuff, using very few lines of code. For example, I went back into my undergrad CS practice exams folder and found a problem asking us to turn this C code\n",
    "<!--![C code](c_code.png)-->\n",
    "<img src=\"c_code.png\" alt=\"C code\" style=\"width:50%;\"/>\n",
    "into assembly code, which turns out to look like this:\n",
    "```assembly\n",
    "sw $ra, ($sp) # store f's return address in the runtime stack\n",
    "sub $sp, $sp, 12 # push return address and both parameters onto stack\n",
    "sw $a0, 8($sp) # store first argument passed into location for p\n",
    "sw $a1, 4($sp) # store second argument passed into location for n\n",
    "lw $t0, 4($sp) # load n\n",
    "mul $t0, $t0, 4 # multiply n by 4 since an int is 4 bytes\n",
    "lw $t1, 8($sp) # load p\n",
    "add $t0, $t0, $t1 # add subscript offset calculated above to value of p\n",
    "lw $a0, ($t0) # load indicated array element\n",
    "li $v0, 1\n",
    "syscall # print element\n",
    "add $sp, $sp, 12 # pop return address and both parameters from stack\n",

    "We're now ready for probably the *main* Python construct you will use in your future endeavors: the **for loop**. A for loop is useful any time you want the program to iterate through a list: whether a sequence of numbers or a list of values. A for loop begins with the keyword `for` and then provides (a) the list to be looped over (`list_name` below) and (b) what you want Python to call the \"current\" item of the list that you're looking at (`variable_name` below). Though this may sound a bit daunting, looking at the code hopefully makes it less so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable_name in list_name:\n",
    "    do a thing using variable_name \n",
    "```"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "So if the list referred to by `list_name` has `N` elements, the code block inside the loop (the \"`do a thing using variable_name`\" part) will be run `N` times (or `N` \"iterations\"), with `variable_name` being updated to point to the subsequent element in the list at the end of each iteration. Thus we can now use this construct to print out our list of GOATs:"
